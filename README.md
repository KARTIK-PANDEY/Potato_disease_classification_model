# Potato_disease_classification_model
The Potato Disease Classification Model is a machine learning project developed to accurately identify and classify various diseases affecting potato crops. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model analyzes images of healthy and diseased potato plants to provide farmers with an efficient tool for early disease detection, Helpful for Farmer
FEATURES:-
Dataset: The model is trained on a dataset containing images of both healthy and diseased potato plants, allowing it to learn and distinguish between different disease patterns.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Leveraging the power of machine learning, the model utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to create an effective classification system for potato diseases.

Early Disease Detection: By accurately identifying diseases in their early stages, the model helps farmers intervene promptly, preventing further spread and minimizing crop losses.

TECH STACKS USED:-
Python: Core programming language for implementing the machine learning model.

Machine Learning: Utilizes machine learning algorithms for training and classification.

TensorFlow and Keras: Frameworks for building and training machine learning models.

Matplotlib: Used for data visualization, allowing for the graphical representation of disease patterns.

Pandas and NumPy: Essential libraries for data manipulation and numerical operations.
